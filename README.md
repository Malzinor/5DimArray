# 5DimArray
App for each dimension generates random number from 1 to 10.</br>
Then shows you for each dimension how much elements each of them is going to have.</br>
If the amounts seem either to big or just dont feel like you want them, you can close down the program by typing Decline/decline or just closing the program with "x".</br>
Obviously opening app again will give you different numbers.</br>
If you want to continue just type in Accept/accept.</br>
After accepting values are randomly generated from 1 to 100 and inserted with for loop inside the array.</br>
Every dimension is going to be shown like this with value at the fifth dimension.</br></br>

Example:</br>
|-First dimension([0]) inside there are:</br>
&emsp;|-Second dimension([0][0]) inside there are:</br>
&emsp;&emsp;|-Third dimension([0][0][0]) inside there are:</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|-Fourth dimension([0][0][0][0]) inside there are:</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|-Fifth dimension([0][0][0][0][0]) inserted value is equal to: 94</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|-Fourth dimension([0][0][0][1]) inside there are:</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|-Fifth dimension([0][0][0][1][0]) inserted value is equal to: 5</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|-Fourth dimension([0][0][0][2]) inside there are:</br>
Etc.</br>

Amount of memory, amount of elements and summary of all values is going to be shown at the very bottom.

Open main.cpp for code (incase you got a little confused).
