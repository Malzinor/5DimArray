# 5DimArray
App for each dimension generates random number from 1 to 10. 
Then shows you for each dimension how much elements each of them is going to have. 
If the amounts seem either to big or just dont feel like you want them, you can close down the program by typing Decline/decline or just closing the program with "x". 
Obviously opening app again will give you different numbers. 
If you want to continue just type in Accept/accept. 
After accepting values are randomly generated from 1 to 100 and inserted with for loop inside the array. 
Every dimension is going to be shown like this with value at the fifth dimension.

Example:
-First dimension([0]) inside there are:
 -Second dimension([0][0]) inside there are:
  -Third dimension([0][0][0]) inside there are:
   -Fourth dimension([0][0][0][0]) inside there are:
    -Fifth dimension([0][0][0][0][0]) inserted value is equal to: 94
   -Fourth dimension([0][0][0][1]) inside there are:
    -Fifth dimension([0][0][0][1][0]) inserted value is equal to: 5
   -Fourth dimension([0][0][0][2]) inside there are:
Etc.

Amount of memory, amount of elements and summary of all values is going to be shown at the very bottom.

Open main.cpp for code (incase you got a little confused).
